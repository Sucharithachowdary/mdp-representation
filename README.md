# MDP REPRESENTATION

## AIM:
The representation of real world scenario using Markov Decision Process by stating all the states,actions and environment with respective rewards.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To develop a game which will promote to other level,when the agent complete its task correctly.
### Problem Description
If the agent unable to complete the given task,then there is no promotion to other level,when it reaches the final level,it will recieve a reward.

### State Space
{L1,L2,L3}--->{0,1,2}
### Sample State
L1--->{0}

### Action Space
Moving Left(1)

Stay in the same level(0)

### Sample Action
Stay in the same level(0)

### Reward Function
+1(When it reaches the goal state or final level)

## RESULT:
Therefore an MDP representation has been created for a real world scenario with all the states, actions and rewards.
